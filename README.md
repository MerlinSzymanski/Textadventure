# Textadventure
A short textadventure, without any big story yet. 
You are now able to move around, take items, have enemies and a little interaction between them

In the rooms.txt you can create new rooms and set the connection between them (and the direction to enter), the Items located in it, the description (asoasf) -> Check the file header for the exact position of each detaiil

the rooms.py file: Gives you all the codes associated with rooms, change etc
Items.py: Everything associated with Items
