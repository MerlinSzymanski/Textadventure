# Textadventure
A short textadventure, without any big story yet. It is now possible to create rooms and Items and walk between rooms. The underlying Idea stems from this website: https://www.python-forum.de/viewtopic.php?t=29056

In the rooms.txt you can create new rooms and set the connection between them (and the direction to enter), the Items located in it, the description (asoasf) -> Check the file header for the exact position of each detaiil

the rooms.py file: Gives you all the codes associated with rooms, change etc
Items.py: Everything associated with Items
