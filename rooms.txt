R1,     ***At the Castle***,     You stand at a a crossroad within the forrest. It is late in the evening but still light enough to see your surroundings. The path in front of you leads to the north - you cant really see where it ends. To the east a small path leads into the woods. In the west the forrest stands pitch black. Even if you wanted to go there - there is no way to do so, 		You stand at a crossroad near a castle,		The floor around the castle is flooded with rocks and old grass - but you dont find anythin usefull here. However - you see the castle quite clear and spot a door in the distance, 	north:R2;east:R3;castle:R6;west:R7;forrest:R7,	 ,
